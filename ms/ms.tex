\begin{abstract}
Interaction-free measurement refers to quantum phenomena such as the
presence of a photon absorber being inferred without it absorbing any
photons.  We review the physics and its realization in interferometric
experiments.  We then consider a simple classical system: two coupled
oscillators, one of which is damped.  The energy dissipation can be
made arbitrarily small by making the damping large enough.  The
phenomenon can be considered analogous to interaction-free
measurement.

\section{Interaction-free measurement}

Many quantum paradoxes have been explored theoretically and
experimentally in recent years.  Most involve entanglement of two
qubits, and several examples are in Mermin's
book\cite{2007qucosc.book}.  Entanglement has no classical analog.

There are also counter-intuitive quantum phenonema not involving
entanglement.  The best known of these is interaction-free
measurement. Following its initial
suggestion\cite{1993FoPh...23..987E} and refinement and first
experimentals\cite{PhysRevLett.74.4763} it has been the subject of
many demonstrations\cite{voorthuysen:1504,2006JPhB...39.3177N} and
reviews.\cite{deweerd:272} The basic idea is as follows
\begin{itemize}
\item Start with a state $\ket0$.
\item Repeat the following $N$ times.
\begin{itemize}
\item Rotate the state away from $\ket0$ towards $\ket1$ by $\pi/(2N)$.
\item If there is an absorber, measure the state, otherwise do
  nothing. If the state is measured and is $\ket1$ abort the
  experiment.
\end{itemize}
\item Measure the state (if the experiment has not been aborted).  If
  the state is $\ket0$ we infer an absorber. If $\ket1$ there is is no
  absorber.
\end{itemize}
If $N$ is very large, the chance of an abort becomes arbitrarily
small.  An example of the quantum Zeno effect.

An older usage of similar
terminalogy\cite{springerlink:10.1007/BF01327019,dicke:925} refers to
a situation where a non-detection enables an inference.

\section{Interferometric picture}

Most discussion in the literature is in terms of a Mach-Zehnder
interferometer.  With the help of Figure~{\ref{fig:mz}} we can relate
this to qubit notation.
\begin{equation}
\ket0 \equiv \left( \begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 0 \end{array} \right)  \qquad
\ket1 \equiv \left( \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 1 \end{array} \right)  \qquad
\X \equiv \left( \begin{array}{cc} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{array} \right)
\end{equation}
A mirror acts as a swap operator $i\X$ and a beam-splitter acts as
\begin{equation}
e^{i\alpha\X} \equiv \cos\alpha + i\sin\alpha\,\X
\end{equation}
Then $\sin^2\frac12\alpha$ is the reflectivity.

The whole interferometer applies the operation
\begin{equation}
e^{i\alpha\X} i\X e^{i\alpha\X} = -\sin2\alpha + i\cos2\alpha X
\end{equation}
which is a rotation in qubit space.

If we write
\begin{equation}
\alpha = \frac\pi2 - \epsilon
\end{equation}
then we have
\begin{equation}
-\sin2\epsilon + i\cos2\epsilon X
\end{equation}


The operation can be concatenated, say $N$ times.  Now let us select
\begin{equation}
\alpha = \frac\pi2 \left(1-\frac1N\right)
\end{equation}
If now we start with $\ket0$ and go through the interferometer $N$
times, we are certain to get $\ket0$.

Now put an absorber in one of the arms, as in Figure~\ref{fig:absorb}.
Then, after going through the interferometer $N$ times, the
probability of getting $\ket1$ will be
\begin{equation}
\sin^{4N}\alpha = \cos^{4N} \left(\frac\pi{2N}\right)
\end{equation}
which approaches unity for large $N$.

\section{Coupled oscillators}

Consider two coupled oscillators, one of them damped.
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{l}
\ddot x + x + \kappa y = 0 \\
\ddot y + y + \kappa x + \gamma y = 0
\end{array}
\end{equation}
If $\gamma=0$ has solutions of the form
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{l}
x = \cos(\sqrt{1+\kappa}\,t) + \cos(\sqrt{1-\kappa}\,t)  \\
y = \cos(\sqrt{1+\kappa}\,t) - \cos(\sqrt{1-\kappa}\,t)
\end{array}
\end{equation}
and the amplitude sloshes from one to the other.

With damping, easiest to solve using Laplace transform. For the
initial conditions $x(0)=1$ and $\dot x(0) = y(0) = \dot y(0) = 0$ we
have
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{l}
s^2 X - s + X + \kappa Y = 0 \\
s^2 Y + Y + \kappa X + \gamma s Y = 0
\end{array}
\end{equation}
For strong damping, we have to $O(1/\gamma)$
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{l}
\displaystyle
X = \frac s{s^2+1} + \frac{\kappa^2}\gamma \frac1{(s^2+1)^2} \\
\displaystyle
Y = -\frac\kappa\gamma \frac1{s^2+1}
\end{array}
\end{equation}
Solution to $O(1/\gamma)$
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{l}
\displaystyle
x = \cos t + \frac{\kappa^2}{2\gamma} (\sin t - t\cos t) \\
\displaystyle
y = -\frac\kappa\gamma \sin t
\end{array}
\end{equation}
Amplitude damping rate $\propto\kappa^2/\gamma$.

For mechanical oscillators, it may be counter-intuitive that more
damping means less energy dissipation.  In the electrical case (an LC
circuit coupled to an RLC circuit) it is obvious that increasing
resistance reduces dissipation.
