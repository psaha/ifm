\begin{abstract}
Interaction-free measurement refers to quantum phenomena such as the
presence of a photon absorber being inferred without it absorbing any
photons.  We review the physics and its realization in interferometric
experiments.  We then consider a simple classical system: two coupled
oscillators, one of which is damped; the energy dissipation can be
made arbitrarily small by making the damping large enough.  The
phenomenon can be considered analogous to interaction-free
measurement.

\section{Interaction-free measurement}

Many quantum paradoxes have been explored theoretically and
experimentally in recent years.  Most involve entangled states: the
famous EPR paradox is an old example, and quantum computing is a more
recent development\cite{2007qucosc.book}.  Entanglement is considered
an intrinsically quantum phenonemn classical analog.

There are also counter-intuitive quantum phenonema not involving
entanglement.  Imagine a photon, initially in a ``vertical'' polarized
state.  It is sent through a Faraday rotator, and then through a
vertically polarizing sheet.  The former rotates the polarization
plane towards ``horizontal'' by small angle, say $\pi/(2N)$, where $N$
is large.  The latter effectively measures the polarization state in
the vertical/horizontal basis; if the result comes out horizontal, the
photon is absorbed, otherwise it goes through in a vertical
eigenstate.  Since $N$ is large, the chances of being absorbed are
small.  Most likely, the photon will get slightly rotated and then
reset to vertical.  If the photon is re-routed back to the apparatus
$N$ times, it will still most likely emerge vertically polarized.  The
rotator and the polarizer appear to cancel each other out.  The
general phenomenon is known as the quantum Zeno
effect,\cite{PhysRevA.41.2295} but it can also be described in
everyday language, in terms of waking and sleeping
states.\cite{orzel2009teach}

What happens if we now remove the polarizer?  Clearly, the $N$ Faraday
rotations will take the photon to a horizontal state.  Thus, the net
effect of the polarizer is (most likely) to rotate a photon from
horizontal to vertical.  Recall that the polarizer is really just an
absorber of horizontal photons.  Yet it can, within a clever setup, be
made to rotate photons instead of absorbing them.  This is the essence
of interaction-free measurement.  Since the initial suggestion
(essentially the $N=1$ case)\cite{1993FoPh...23..987E} and
generalization to the now-standard form, together with the first
experiments\cite{PhysRevLett.74.4763} interaction-free measurement has
been the subject of many
demonstrations\cite{voorthuysen:1504,2006JPhB...39.3177N} and
reviews,\cite{deweerd:272} and applications aiming towards medical
imaging are starting to appear\cite{PhysRevA.80.040902}.  (An older
usage of similar
terminalogy\cite{springerlink:10.1007/BF01327019,dicke:925} refers to
a situation where a non-detection enables an inference.)


It can be readily understood through a thought experiment, as follows.
Consider a single photon, which can be in an arbitrary superposition
of two states, say $\ket0$ and $\ket1$.  We are also given a glass
sheet, which can be one of two kinds: clear or dark.  A clear glass
let all photons through, whereas the dark variety lets only $\ket0$
photons through, and absorbs $\ket1$ photons.  We wish to test what
kind of glass we have been given, and do the following experiment.
\begin{itemize}
\item Start with the photon in state $\ket0$.
\item Repeat the following $N$ times.
\begin{itemize}
\item Rotate the state of the photon away from $\ket0$ towards $\ket1$
  by one part in $N$.
\item Send the photon through the glass.  If the glass is clear,
  nothing happens.  If the glass is dark, it measures the state
  of the photon as either $\ket0$ or $\ket1$, and
\begin{itemize}
\item {\em either\/} the photon comes through, in eigenstate $\ket0$,
\item {\em or\/} the photon is absorbed, and the experiment aborts.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item If the photon has not been absorbed, measure its state.
\end{itemize}
\noindent If the final measurement results in $\ket1$.  If the glass
was dark, the state must be $\ket0$.  If $N=1$, the glass receives a
photon in the state $\frac1{sqrt2}\left(\ket0+\ket1\right)$.  A dark
glass then has a 50\% probability of absorbing the photon.  In this
case, we have inferred the presence of a photon absorber without it
having absorbed any photons.  

With no absorber, the state oscillates between $\ket0$ and $\ket1$,
whereas with absorption of $\ket1$ the state stays in $\ket0$.

In this paper, we relate the above simple picture on the one hand to
the standard description of interaction-free measurement in terms of
an interferometric setup, and on the other hand to a classical system
of coupled oscillators.

\section{Interferometric picture}

Most discussion in the literature is in terms of a Mach-Zehnder
interferometer.  With the help of Figure~{\ref{fig:mz}} we can relate
this to qubit notation.
\begin{equation}
\ket0 \equiv \left( \begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 0 \end{array} \right)  \qquad
\ket1 \equiv \left( \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 1 \end{array} \right)  \qquad
\X \equiv \left( \begin{array}{cc} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{array} \right)
\end{equation}
A mirror acts as a swap operator $i\X$ and a beam-splitter acts as
\begin{equation}
e^{i\alpha\X} \equiv \cos\alpha + i\sin\alpha\,\X
\end{equation}
Then $\sin^2\frac12\alpha$ is the reflectivity.

The whole interferometer applies the operation
\begin{equation}
e^{i\alpha\X} i\X e^{i\alpha\X} = -\sin2\alpha + i\cos2\alpha X
\end{equation}
which is a rotation in qubit space.

If we write
\begin{equation}
\alpha = \frac\pi2 - \epsilon
\end{equation}
then we have
\begin{equation}
-\sin2\epsilon + i\cos2\epsilon X
\end{equation}


The operation can be concatenated, say $N$ times.  Now let us select
\begin{equation}
\alpha = \frac\pi2 \left(1-\frac1N\right)
\end{equation}
If now we start with $\ket0$ and go through the interferometer $N$
times, we are certain to get $\ket0$.

Now put an absorber in one of the arms, as in Figure~\ref{fig:absorb}.
Then, after going through the interferometer $N$ times, the
probability of getting $\ket1$ will be
\begin{equation}
\sin^{4N}\alpha = \cos^{4N} \left(\frac\pi{2N}\right)
\end{equation}
which approaches unity for large $N$.

\section{Coupled oscillators}

Consider two coupled oscillators, one of them damped.
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{l}
\ddot x + x + \kappa y = 0 \\
\ddot y + y + \kappa x + \gamma y = 0
\end{array}
\end{equation}
If $\gamma=0$ has solutions of the form
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{l}
x = \cos(\sqrt{1+\kappa}\,t) + \cos(\sqrt{1-\kappa}\,t)  \\
y = \cos(\sqrt{1+\kappa}\,t) - \cos(\sqrt{1-\kappa}\,t)
\end{array}
\end{equation}
and the amplitude sloshes from one to the other.

With damping, easiest to solve using Laplace transform. For the
initial conditions $x(0)=1$ and $\dot x(0) = y(0) = \dot y(0) = 0$ we
have
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{l}
s^2 X - s + X + \kappa Y = 0 \\
s^2 Y + Y + \kappa X + \gamma s Y = 0
\end{array}
\end{equation}
For strong damping, we have to $O(1/\gamma)$
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{l}
\displaystyle
X = \frac s{s^2+1} + \frac{\kappa^2}\gamma \frac1{(s^2+1)^2} \\
\displaystyle
Y = -\frac\kappa\gamma \frac1{s^2+1}
\end{array}
\end{equation}
Solution to $O(1/\gamma)$
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{l}
\displaystyle
x = \cos t + \frac{\kappa^2}{2\gamma} (\sin t - t\cos t) \\
\displaystyle
y = -\frac\kappa\gamma \sin t
\end{array}
\end{equation}
Amplitude damping rate $\propto\kappa^2/\gamma$.

For mechanical oscillators, it may be counter-intuitive that more
damping means less energy dissipation.  In the electrical case (an LC
circuit coupled to an RLC circuit) it is obvious that increasing
resistance reduces dissipation.
